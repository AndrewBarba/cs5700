#### Run

	node index.js $dir

#### About

I chose to write a small program in Node.js inorder to parse the captured
network data. Node provides convenient event based API for parsing packets
one-by-one instead of as a whole. The event based API makes it wasy to scan
smaller chunks of data instead of one large file the way the the proveded
scripts operate. By parsing smaller chunks at a time the script runs much
faster and uses less memory. 

#### Summary

After running Meddle on my iPhone 6 I have came away with a few interesting
pieces of information. First of all, a large majority of traffic from my phone
is being sent over TLS/SSL. I expected this, however, it was nice to confirm
this after analyzing the data. Something I did not expect was the sheer mass
of data being sent and recieved by the device. I don't watch a lot of video
and I rarely use apps like Instagram or Facebook which are very image heavy.
A lot of the data was actually tracking related. Simply by looking at the
request URI and seeing `/track` was enough to confirm that the request is meant
to track some piece of information. I was also surprised to see the number of 
Apple related pings my device sends. I don't use any Apple apps except for the
built in Messages app, however, my device frequently phones home to Apple with
information from Plists. My assumtion is that the device is frequently grabbing
configuration data from Apple as well as reporting device statistics. 

#### PII

After combing through the data for personal infroamtion, I was only able to find
references to my first and last name. The majority of these references came from
Instagram which appears to be downloading images over an unencrypted connection
and thus leaks the cookies sent along with the request. In these cookies is my
username, session_id, and access_token. I was not able to confirm that the
session_id and access_token could be used to spoof an account however. I also
want to bring up the frequent references to GPS coordinates. Location tracking
is somewhat of a hot topic as of late however I am not conviced the coordinates
being sent are infact my location. Many students posted lat/lon from Yahoo! 
Weather and I find it hard to believe they are actually sending exact user
coordinates as opposed to general Boston, New York etc. coordinates. Regardless,
the data sent is enough to pinpoint a user within a couple of miles.
