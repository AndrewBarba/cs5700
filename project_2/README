#### Summary ####

We began this project by visiting the Fakebook site on a desktop with the 
Google Chrome browser. After quickly testing our login and clicking around
We began inspecting network calls via the Chrome Developer Tools. There's really
no need to inspect Javascript or HTML as our project is strictly making network
calls. After learning some of the requests that were being sent we began deleting
cookies and refreshing the page to see how the server was handling them. It 
became clear that cookies were the main way of persisting a login throughout 
the site. 

With a decent understanding of how the site works, we began building two 
solutions to the project, one written in Node.js and one written and Java. This 
let the both us learn each other's coding styles and explore a new language
through the eye's of someone who is profecient in that language. One of us was
well versed in Node.js and the other was well versed in Java. By understanding 
two solutions we feel we were able to experiment and explore performance, code
quality, and readibility in a relatively simple and straight forward project.
